# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2024 challenges implemented in Go.

## Project Structure

Each day's challenge is in its own directory (e.g., `02.12` for December 2nd), containing:
- `part1/` - Solution for part 1
- `part2/` - Solution for part 2
- `input.txt` - Challenge input
- `example.txt` - Example input for testing

## Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
cd [day directory]  # cd 04.12
go run ./cmd
```
